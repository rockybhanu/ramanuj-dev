Hello, I'm Ramanuj, a software developer by hobby and a seasoned Linux and Kubernetes administrator. Throughout my career in infrastructure engineering, I have taken on multiple roles, including Linux Administrator, Kubernetes Administrator, Site Reliability Engineer (SRE), DevOps Engineer, and Cloud Engineer.

I am passionate about technology and always eager to learn and implement cutting-edge solutions. I spend a significant amount of time in my home lab, experimenting with new technologies to gain hands-on experience.

Currently, I work for a large investment bank, where I apply my expertise in cloud engineering to solve complex problems and improve infrastructure reliability.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, swimming, and listening to music. I am also a proud parent of two wonderful kids, Nikunj (M-11) and Mitakshi (F-2). Weekends are dedicated to family outings and exploring new places together.

Below are some snapshots from my life:
